# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance




## Side note 
The aim of this project is to use the various classification algorithms to classify employees based on attrition. There are number of columns in the data which give information about each employee in IBM dataset. We have to visualise this data and take suitable columns which will affect attrition the most. Then run this data through various supervised classification algorithms to give predictions.  
This project was a group project in my data science class, it was impossible to do it without the help of my teammates.
### Prerequisites

```
Data pre-processing, Scoring metrics, Visualization, Hyperparameter tuning, classification algorithms
```
```
knowledge of Python (I've used iPython notebook but you can run this code on whatever you are comfortable with.
```
## Outline followed

   * Visualization of the data
   * Identifying different relationships in the data
   * Selecting the different features that are relevant for the prediction of Attrition
   * Pre-processing data (scaling, encoding categorical variables)
   * Separating dataset into test and train sets
   * Oversampling by SMOTE (as the 'Attrition' isnt a balanced variable)
   * Exploring different classification algorithms
   * Hyperparameter tuning
   * Calculating different metrics (F1, Precision, Accuracy, Recall, etc)
   * Comparing different models
   * Providing import features for the best model


## Instructions
The ipython(attrition.ipyb) notebook is self explanatory. Run each cell sequentially.
